# Personal Web Portfolio & GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is a personal web portfolio designed and deployed using GitHub
Pages to professionally showcase projects, technical skills, and resume
content. The site functions as a central hub for personal branding and is built
with scalability and maintainability in mind.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a clean, professional, and easily
maintainable personal website that consolidates key information such as
projects, technical skills, and resume materials into a single public-facing
platform.

Rather than a single-page site, the portfolio is structured as a multi-page
static website to support future growth and clear content separation.

## Site Structure
mitsu-hub.github.io/
├── index.html # Landing page (About, summary, quick links)
├── style.css # Shared global styles for all pages
├── resume.pdf # Downloadable resume
└── portfolio/
└── index.html # Detailed projects and technical portfolio


### Structure Design Rationale

- **Separation of concerns**  
  The landing page (`index.html`) provides a concise overview, while detailed
  project descriptions are placed in the `/portfolio` directory.

- **Scalability**  
  Additional sections such as `/blog`, `/labs`, or `/projects` can be added
  without restructuring the existing site.

- **Consistency**  
  A single shared CSS file ensures a unified visual style across all pages.

- **Maintainability**  
  Static files and GitHub Pages hosting minimize complexity while enabling easy
  updates and version control through Git.
